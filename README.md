# Node.js Practice

A robust RESTful API server template built with Node.js and Express.

## Overview

This template provides a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable RESTful APIs using Node.js. It includes authentication, database integration, testing setup, and best practices for API development, based on the guidelines from [factory.dev's blog](https://factory.dev/blog/how-to-build-api).

## OBJECTIVES

- Establish a Robust Project Architecture
- Ensure Type Safety and Developer Productivity
- Implement Secure and Flexible Authentication Mechanisms
- Facilitate Database Interaction through ORM
- Ensure High Code Reliability
- Provide Interactive and Up-to-Date API Documentation

## Features

- Authentication:

  - Register
  - Login

- Post:

  - Get all posts
  - Create a new post
  - Update a post
  - Delete a post

- Comment:

  - Get all comments of a post
  - Create a new comment
  - Update a comment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Database (SQLite)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.asoft-python.com:van.tran/nodejs-training.git
cd nodejs-training
checkout practice/twitter-api
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your settings
```

4. Run database migrations (if applicable):

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

5. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Generates API documentation and starts the server
- `npm test` - Runs the test suite

## Testing

The project uses Mocha as the test runner, Chai for assertions, and Supertest for HTTP testing:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests are organized by modules and run in a dedicated test environment to ensure the main database is not affected.

## API Documentation

API documentation is automatically generated from inline comments using Swagger. After starting the server, access the documentation at:

```
http://localhost:3000/swagger/
```
